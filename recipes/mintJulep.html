    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>There was never a shortage of alcohol at the numerous parties in The Great Gatsby , 
        <i>even though these were the times of American Prohibition</i>. One of Daisy's favorite drinks was the Mint julep. 
        It's a traditional cocktail from the American South, probably Virginia. This drink is traditionally served during the Kentucky Derby, 
        with approximately 80,000 drinks served over the two days of racing.
